## Hi there, I'm Monali Nayak 👋
### Senior Platform Engineer @ Elastic | Cloud Native & AI Infrastructure

I bridge the gap between **Application Logic** and **Deep Infrastructure**, building resilient systems that don't break at 3 AM. 

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of **SRE and GenAI**, architecting production-ready environments for Large Language Models.  
Beyond just "keeping the lights on", I specialize in designing **Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)** creating self-service paved paths that empower developers to innovate while enforcing enterprise-grade security and compliance.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On
- **AI Infrastructure:** Re-architecting GKE clusters to support high-scale GenAI workloads.
- **AI/ML Ops:** Implementation of **Envoy AI Gateway** and **MCP Servers** for enterprise use cases.
- **Cloud Native Governance:** Driving the adoption of **GitOps** and **Policy as Code** to standardize deployments and enhance reliability across Enterprise.
