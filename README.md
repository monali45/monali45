# Hi there, I'm Monali Nayak 👋
### Senior Platform Engineer @ Elastic | Cloud Native & AI Infrastructure

I bridge the gap between **Application Logic** and **Deep Infrastructure**, building resilient systems that don't break at 3 AM. 

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of **SRE and GenAI**, architecting production-ready environments for Large Language Models. [cite_start]Beyond just "keeping the lights on," I specialize in designing **Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)**—creating self-service paved paths that empower developers to innovate while enforcing enterprise-grade security and compliance.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
When I'm not debugging distributed systems, I trade infrastructure code for a paintbrush. 
You can find me on my yoga mat 🧘🏻‍♀️, working on a new painting 🎨, or hunting for the city's best food spots.🍝
